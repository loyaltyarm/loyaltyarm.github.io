      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Senior Systems Engineer on the Developer Productivity team at Uber Advanced Technologies. At Uber ATG, my main focus is building reliable, (sometimes) immutable infrastructure or services to improve the developer experience for self-driving engineers.
In previous years at Uber, I built, managed, and supported mobile continuous integration infrastructure for our massive mobile engineering organization. In addition, I also provided full support for Uber&amp;rsquo;s global core business operations in areas such as endpoint management, telecommunications strategy, network topologies, and scalability planning and design.</description>
