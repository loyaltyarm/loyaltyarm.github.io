&lt;h1 id=&#34;wat&#34;&gt;Wat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move &lt;a href=&#34;https://cobbservations.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Cobbservations&lt;/a&gt; to a site powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I stumbled across &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; recently while working with the maintainers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/micromdm&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;micromdm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://micromdm.io&#34;&gt;beautiful site&lt;/a&gt; hosting the documentation is build with &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, and given the looks, I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat separately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markdowntutorial.com&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging. I even recently re-formatted all of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loyaltyarm/splunk&#34;&gt;splunk repo&lt;/a&gt; searches to a more uniform Markdown syntax. So, I&amp;rsquo;m undertaking a project of moving my blog contents over to Github hosting and plan to use &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one of the main features I like about Wordpress is its social network integration. This makes it super easy to update your LinkedIn network or Twitter followers that you&amp;rsquo;ve published a new post. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to include this functionality in the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; site when I get more time to figure out how to get that going.&lt;/p&gt;
