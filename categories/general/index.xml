      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Senior Systems Engineer on the Developer Productivity team at Uber Advanced Technologies. At Uber ATG, my main focus is building reliable, (sometimes) immutable infrastructure or services to improve the developer experience for self-driving engineers.
In previous years at Uber, I built, managed, and supported mobile continuous integration infrastructure for our massive mobile engineering organization. In addition, I also provided full support for Uber&amp;rsquo;s global core business operations in areas such as endpoint management, telecommunications strategy, network topologies, and scalability planning and design.</description>

      <description>Wat This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move Cobbservations to a site powered by Hugo. I stumbled across hugo recently while working with the maintainers of the micromdm project. The beautiful site hosting the documentation is build with hugo, and given the looks, I just had to try it.
Somewhat separately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Markdown for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging.</description>
