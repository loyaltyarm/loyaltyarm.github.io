      <description>Wat This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move Cobbservations to a site powered by Hugo. I stumbled across hugo recently while working with the maintainers of the micromdm project. The beautiful site hosting the documentation is build with hugo, and given the looks, I just had to try it.
Somewhat separately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Markdown for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging.</description>
