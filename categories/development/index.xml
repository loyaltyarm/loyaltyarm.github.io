      <description>While fumbling my way through a bootstrapping workflow for macOS Sierra, I found that recent updates to Homebrew now require the latest version of Xcode when the machine in question is running macOS Sierra.
It looks like the check boils down to a scenario when the relevant machine is running macOS Sierra AND does NOT have the CI attribute.
If the CI attribute is specified, then the Homebrew check will proceed and allow a different version of Xcode to be installed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a personal project that involves the use of the Google Maps SDK for iOS. As I am still picking up various tidbits and skills related to iOS development, I did a bit of learning first in order to get started. Code School recently opened up a free channel for learning about using Google Maps SDK for iOS, and that has been pretty helpful. According to the Google Maps SDK documentation, there are various ways to create a mapView and assign its camera position, or force a camera update.</description>
