&lt;h1 id=&#34;wat&#34;&gt;Wat&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move &lt;a href=&#34;https://cobbservations.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Cobbservations&lt;/a&gt; to a site powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I stumbled across &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; recently while working with the maintainers of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/micromdm&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;micromdm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://micromdm.io&#34;&gt;beautiful site&lt;/a&gt; hosting the documentation is build with &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, and given the looks, I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat separately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markdowntutorial.com&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging. I even recently re-formatted all of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loyaltyarm/splunk&#34;&gt;splunk repo&lt;/a&gt; searches to a more uniform Markdown syntax. So, I&amp;rsquo;m undertaking a project of moving my blog contents over to Github hosting and plan to use &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, one of the main features I like about Wordpress is its social network integration. This makes it super easy to update your LinkedIn network or Twitter followers that you&amp;rsquo;ve published a new post. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to include this functionality in the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; site when I get more time to figure out how to get that going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building OS X Test Environments in VMWare Fusion w/ System Image Utility</title>

&lt;p&gt;A while ago, Rich Trouton posted a method for setting up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/building-mac-test-environments-with-vmware-fusion-netboot-and-deploystudio/&#34;&gt;easily maintainable OSX virtual machine environment for testing&lt;/a&gt;, using DeployStudio (DSS) and a few other tools. His method is great because it allows you to build a specific test image (base) and store that as a workflow and master pair in your DSS environment. As Rich showed, it then becomes very easy to get going quickly when you need a fresh virtual machine to test new applications or other scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With today’s release of OS X Mavericks at WWDC, I found myself wanting to test a few things from the Developer beta(s) in a virtual machine but quickly realized I hadn’t really setup the ideal environment Rich describes in my home test lab, despite having the necessary equipment. I thought about running through my home DSS setup to get a test VM workflow setup, but due to the somewhat ‘temporary’ status of the developer beta, I didn’t want to spend too much time setting things up–what with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/06/10/game-of-thrones-season-3-finale-review-winter-is-coming/#559f63364008&#34;&gt;the coming winter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tv.com/news/falling-skies-season-3-premiere-review-cowboys-and-aliens-137061338448/&#34;&gt;impending alien attacks&lt;/a&gt; waiting for me over on the media center. Needless to say, I wanted something I could set and forget for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll use System Image Utility, I thought. I set about creating a NetBoot set using System Image Utility, and used Rich’s method of setting up a VMWare Fusion virtual machine to boot to the .nbi and get things installed. You can do this at home yourself as well. You’ll need the following to get started….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS X Mountain Lion Server (or other recent version) –for the NetInstall service and System Image Utility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS X Mountain Lion installer application (downloaded from the Mac App Store)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMWare Fusion 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some great shows to catch up on…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-started&#34;&gt;Get Started:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and configure OS X Mountain Lion Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup the NetInstall service. A good walkthrough of Steps 2 and 3 is available here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use System Image Utility to build the NetBoot set (.nbi). See italics at Step 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/01/23/building-mac-test-environments-with-vmware-fusion-netboot-and-deploystudio/&#34;&gt;Rich’s procedure&lt;/a&gt; for setting up a virtual machine to NetBoot using your .nbi. (See ‘Configuring the VM’ section of his post.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my setup, I was able to netboot the virtual machine to the netboot set while running both on the same system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VM should begin with the OS installation prompts at such time that the NetBooting process has completed. Follow the prompts to install and reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
