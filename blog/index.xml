      <description>Wat This is the initial post in a series of steps I am taking to move Cobbservations to a site powered by Hugo. I stumbled across hugo recently while working with the maintainers of the micromdm project. The beautiful site hosting the documentation is build with hugo, and given the looks, I just had to try it.
Somewhat separately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Markdown for quite a while and have finally gotten around to enjoying it more than standard wordpress-style content for blogging.</description>

      <description>Recently I ran across a post about setting up Splunk to work with DeployStudio via Noel Balonso. I began using Splunk for reporting on my Apple and Windows (test) imaging environments, to much satisfaction.
In the meantime, I have also been working with McAfee’s EEMac product for full-disk encryption in OS X. Our org has been comparing its performance to FileVault 2 and trying to make a decision as to whether or not to proceed based on our existing environment for Windows management, which also utilizes McAfee’s FDE product for Windows (formerly Safeboot).</description>

      <description>A while ago, Rich Trouton posted a method for setting up an easily maintainable OSX virtual machine environment for testing, using DeployStudio (DSS) and a few other tools. His method is great because it allows you to build a specific test image (base) and store that as a workflow and master pair in your DSS environment. As Rich showed, it then becomes very easy to get going quickly when you need a fresh virtual machine to test new applications or other scenarios.</description>
