                <p>This is a relatively stupid problem that took me a few seconds to figure out, but I figured I would post on it anyway. I have recently been working with <a href="https://github.com/munki/createOSXinstallPkg"><code>createosxinstallpkg</code></a>, part of the tool set included to administer <a href="https://github.com/munki/munki">Munki</a>, an open source managed software update server (and client) for OS X machines.</p>

<p>I used <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> last year when I needed to build a never-booted upgrade package to for 10.7 clients to upgrade to 10.8.2, which was being certified in our enterprise environment at the time. Despite the fact that OS X Mavericks 10.9 is offered to users as a free upgrade, we have several users who feel more comfortable letting IT perform the work, so I use <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> to create the never-booted upgrade package our techs use to perform the &ldquo;supervised&rdquo; upgrades.</p>

<p>In our environment, we have a proxy server for all outgoing traffic to the public internet. I noticed that during the process to check against Apple&rsquo;s software update catalog for the location of the incompatible applications package file, that the <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> job was failing after not being able to hit <code>swscan.apple.com:443</code> and ultimately timing out. After some inspection of the <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> source code, I saw that the python script is actually performing a <code>curl</code> against the software update catalog and subsequent location to find the incompatible applications package. I knew that I was going to have to specify to curl that I was behind a proxy, either by editing the source or by providing environment variables. When I chose to just specify the environment variables, I used the command:</p>

<pre><code>export https_proxy=https://internet.proxyserver.mycompany.com:3128/
</code></pre>

<p>Soon after entering and having the package creation fail again, I realized I did not correctly specify my credentials to authenticate to our proxy server for https traffic. I edited my command and subsequent environment variable per below:</p>

<pre><code>export https_proxy=https://username:password@internet.proxyserver.mycompany.com:3128/
</code></pre>

<p>Great, now my syntax is working for me&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to be golden üèÜ. Then I realized I was editing environment variables for <code>curl</code> to use on my local administrator&rsquo;s environment variable file. Since <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> runs as the root user, I needed to make this change to the root user&rsquo;s environment variable instead.</p>

<p>Once I realized the err of my ways, and made the correct environment variable edit for the root user, <code>createosxinstallpkg</code> was able to successfully communicate for its files. Silly problem, but I wanted to document it anyway in case someone starts banging their head like I did for a second.</p>
